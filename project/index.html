            <br><br>
            <div class="div3">
                <p class="p9">
                    I started my journey as a programmer at <u>14</u> in <span class="span1"><u>GOA (Goal-Oriented-Academy)</u></span>, where my passion for technology was ignited. Initially, I began with <span class="span2">Python</span>, which seemed like a perfect starting point due to its simplicity and versatility. As I began to grasp the basics of programming, I expanded my knowledge into other areas, learning <span class="span3">HTML</span>, <span class="span4">CSS</span>, and <span class="span5">JavaScript</span> to understand the world of web development. The web development world fascinated me, but my journey was just beginning, and I was eager to learn more. 
                    Over the years, I continued to learn and evolve, diving deeper into both game development and software programming. If you are curious about the languages I've explored and whether I recommend them or not, keep reading‚Äîthere‚Äôs plenty more to discover. 
                    My game development journey started gaining momentum after I finished <span class="span5">JavaScript</span>. That‚Äôs when I discovered the world of <span class="span6">Lua</span>, a language commonly used for scripting in games, and it led me to create my first games in <span class="span7">Roblox</span>, a platform that allowed me to bring my creations to life and gain hands-on experience. From there, I continued to grow as a game developer, learning <span class="span8">Ruby</span> and later diving into <span class="span9">C++</span>, which opened up even more powerful possibilities for game development.
                    As my journey continued, I also began learning <span class="span10">C#/C</span>, which introduced me to game engines like <span class="span12">Unity</span>, allowing me to create more advanced and immersive games. Along the way, I worked with libraries like <span class="span11">PyGames</span>, which helped me further expand my knowledge of game design and mechanics. 
                    However, my learning didn‚Äôt stop there. As I explored the world of game development, I realized how crucial design was to making a truly immersive experience. So, I started learning design for games too, experimenting with different styles and techniques. The more I learned, the more I realized that becoming proficient in both programming and design was going to take time. 
                    Don‚Äôt expect to master everything in <u>6 months</u>‚Äîit‚Äôs a long process. It took me <u>years</u> to become comfortable with various languages and design techniques, and I am still learning. There are many things I haven't fully finished, and some projects have been left in the middle due to time constraints or the realization that they weren‚Äôt quite what I expected. But that‚Äôs okay! The journey itself is what matters the most. If you‚Äôre curious about what I‚Äôve fully mastered and what I had to give up along the way, just keep scrolling, and I‚Äôll share more of my experiences.
